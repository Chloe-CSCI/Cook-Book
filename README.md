# Cook-Book
This Project will search for recipes from a recipe search API, and get the information for the user.

### Issues
The issues that I had were mostly in the terminal figuring out how to push the code into GitHub.

## Changes
The changes that I made to the code were:
- I added an ingredients list to the minimul output
- I added a minimum and maximum calories input and an if statement that would output the choice that the user made. I also made calories an argument in the search_recipes function and one of the parameters in the parmas.
- I added a choice to the user if they wanted to save the recipe to their files or not. There is an if statement to go along with it if the user picks the yes option.
- I added a dish type input and put dish type as an argument in the search_recipes function and as a paremeter in params.
- I moved a line of code around. I moved it around so that it would not go into or be a part of an if statement.
